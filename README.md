# Practical Go: Exercises and Examples

This repository contains my implementation of exercises and examples from the "Practical Go" book. It serves as a learning journal and reference as I work through the book's content.

## About the Book

"Practical Go" teaches Go programming through hands-on projects and real-world applications. The book covers fundamental concepts, best practices, and advanced techniques for effective Go development.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by chapters, with each chapter containing the corresponding code examples and exercises:

- **Chapter 1**: Command-line applications with flag parsing
  - A simple greeter application demonstrating CLI functionality
  - Basic error handling and input validation
  - File operations and HTML template generation

## Progress

- [x] Chapter 1: Command-line applications
- [ ] Chapter 2: TBD
- [ ] Chapter 3: TBD
<!-- Will be updated as I progress through the book -->

## Running the Examples

Each chapter's code can be built and run independently. For example, to run the Chapter 1 greeter application:

```bash
# Build the application
go build -o greeter chpt1/flag-parse/main.go

# Run with required flags
./greeter -n 5
```

## Learning Go
Through this repository, I aim to:
- Understand Go's idioms and best practices
- Build practical applications with real-world utility
- Explore Go's standard library and ecosystem
- Develop efficient and maintainable Go code

## Notes

This is a personal learning project. Code organization and implementation details may evolve as I progress through the book and improve my Go skills.
